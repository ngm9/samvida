# llms.txt Specification & Examples

## What is llms.txt?

`llms.txt` is a markdown file placed at `https://yourdomain.com/llms.txt`. It gives LLMs and AI agents a structured, concise overview of a business — who they are, what they offer, and how agents can interact with them.

It is intentionally:
- **Short** — agents read it in constrained contexts
- **Structured** — machine-parseable with named links
- **Honest** — no made-up info, no marketing fluff

---

## Canonical Format (from llmstxt.org)

```
# Title

> One-line summary (blockquote)

Optional free-form markdown (bullet points, short paragraphs)

## Section Name
- [Link Title](url): Optional description

## Another Section
- [Link Title](url): Description
```

### Rules:
1. **H1** (`#`) — business name, exactly one
2. **Blockquote** (`>`) — one sentence summary, right after H1
3. **H2 sections** (`##`) — each section groups related named links
4. **Named links** — every bullet is `- [Title](url): description`. This is not optional.
5. **`## Optional` section** — agents may skip this under token pressure. Put supplementary links here.
6. No tables. No images. No HTML. Pure markdown.

## Our Business llms.txt Structure

2-3 sentences of context (what makes them unique, who they're for)

## Services
## Team
## Clients & Testimonials
## For Agents
## Pricing
## API
## Links
## Optional
```

---

## Section Definitions

### `## Services`
What the business offers. Each service is a named link to a relevant page.
```
## Services
- [Service Name](url): What it does, who it's for
```

### `## Team`
Founders and key people. Builds agent trust in who is behind the business.
```
## Team
- [Founder Name](linkedin-or-profile-url): Role. One-line bio. email@domain.com
```
- Include email if available — agents use this to initiate contact
- LinkedIn profile URL preferred if no personal page
- If team not found publicly: populate from user conversation or omit with a note

### `## Clients & Testimonials`
Social proof. Agents use this to judge fit and credibility. Use subsections for individual clients when detail is available.

```
## Clients & Testimonials

- ICP: [Description of ideal customer profile]
- ICP roles: [Job titles of typical buyers]

### [Client / Company Name]
> "[Verbatim or lightly cleaned quote from their testimonial]" — Name, Role, Company

Problem: [What they were struggling with before]
Outcome: [What changed after using the product]

### [Another Client]
> "[Quote]" — Name, Role

Outcome: [Key result]
```

Rules:
- ICP bullets always come first
- Use `###` subsections for each named client where you have a quote or case study detail
- Quote must be real — verbatim or lightly cleaned from public page. Never invented.
- Problem/Outcome lines are optional — include only if the testimonial or case study gives enough detail
- If you only have a name + one-liner quote (no detail), a single bullet is fine — no need to force a subsection
- If no clients found at all: ask user or omit section entirely

### `## For Agents`
The most important section for agentic commerce. What can an agent actually DO?

**If API/integration info available:**
```
## For Agents
- [Action Name](api-endpoint-url): What this does. Input/output description.
- [Another Action](url): Description
```

**If no API info available:**
```
## For Agents
> ⚠️ Full agentic transaction support is coming in a future version.
- [Contact for agent partnerships](mailto:email): Reach out to discuss integration
```

Never omit this section. If info is missing, say so — don't silently skip it.

### `## Pricing`
```
## Pricing
- [Pricing page](url): Summary — e.g. "per-seat, starts at $X/mo"
```
If unknown: link to pricing page with no summary, or omit if no pricing page exists.

### `## API`
```
## API
- [API Docs](url): REST/GraphQL, base URL, brief description of what's available
```
Document the endpoint URL only. No auth details, no secrets. Agent reads the docs for auth.

### `## Links`
```
## Links
- [Homepage](url)
- [Sign up](url)
- [Contact](mailto:email)
- [Blog](url)
```

### `## Optional`
Supplementary links agents can skip under token pressure.
```
## Optional
- [FAQs](url): Common questions
- [Case studies](url): Detailed customer stories
- [Status page](url): Uptime and incidents
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| ❌ Wrong | ✅ Right |
|---------|---------|
| `- Service name: description` (no link) | `- [Service name](url): description` |
| Inventing pricing or team members | Use `[UNKNOWN]` placeholder, ask user |
| Omitting `## For Agents` | Always include it, even if just a "coming soon" notice |
| Long paragraphs in sections | Named links only — keep it scannable |
| Auth tokens or API keys in API section | URL only — agent reads the docs for auth |
| Making up testimonials | Only use what's publicly available or user-provided |
